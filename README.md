How do I approach designing software?

    What new design skills has your work on the project helped you to craft?
    - I have learned how to use OpenGL and manipulate 3d space to look like a realistic scene. I have also learned how to add textures, change the material of an object and add lighting to a scene. Additionally learning how to add a camera and swap between perspective and orthographic lenses.
    What design process did you follow for your project work?
    - The design process I followed was incremental changes to my 3d scene to constantly improve how it looks.
    How could tactics from your design approach be applied in future work?
    - The modular changes I added can easily be applied to future works. Understanding that having a solid foundation for your code can make future improvements much easier and more easily adjusted.

How do I approach developing programs?

    What new development strategies did you use while working on your 3D scene?
    - I created reuseable functions to help the creation of new objects in the future. Either by streamlining the addition of new textures, or even entire shapes. 
    How did iteration factor into your development?
    - Iteration factored into my development by adjusting any issues i had in real time as I constantly tested my code. Trying to get specific shapes to line up could be difficult, especially if the objects were rotateed. This took much trial and error 
    How has your approach to developing code evolved throughout the milestones, which led you to the projectâ€™s completion?
    - My approach to devloping code has become much more modular. I can finally see why reusability is so important. IF I had to go though the lengthy process of making each shape, with their textures from scratch it would be a nightmare.

How can computer science help me in reaching my goals?

    How do computational graphics and visualizations give you new knowledge and skills that can be applied in your future educational pathway?
    - Creating 3d scenes or any computational graphic can be useful in the future for trying to express what Im trying to show in a more clear and consise way. 
    How do computational graphics and visualizations give you new knowledge and skills that can be applied in your future professional pathway
    - In the future I'd like to work with large data sets and be able to simplify what they mean for others. Visualizations are a great way to do that and with the skills I've learned here I can find easier and more understandable ways to show data to people.
